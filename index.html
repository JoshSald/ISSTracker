                <!-- iss FAQ -->
                <h4>What is the International Space Station?</h4>
                <p>
                  The International Space Station is a large spacecraft. It
                  orbits around Earth. It is a home where astronauts live.
                  <br /><br />

                  The space station is also a science lab. Many countries worked
                  together to build it. They also work together to use it.
                  <br /><br />

                  The space station is made of many pieces. The pieces were put
                  together in space by astronauts. The space station's orbit is
                  approximately 250 miles above Earth. NASA uses the station to
                  learn about living and working in space. These lessons will
                  help NASA explore space.
                </p>

                <h4>How Old Is the Space Station?</h4>
                <p>
                  The first piece of the International Space Station was
                  launched in 1998. A Russian rocket launched that piece. After
                  that, more pieces were added. Two years later, the station was
                  ready for people. The first crew arrived on November 2, 2000.
                  People have lived on the space station ever since. Over time
                  more pieces have been added. NASA and its partners around the
                  world finished the space station in 2011.
                </p>

                <h4>How Big Is the Space Station?</h4>
                <p>
                  The space station is as big inside as a house with five
                  bedrooms. It has two bathrooms, a gymnasium and a big bay
                  window. Six people are able to live there. It weighs almost a
                  million pounds. It is big enough to cover a football field
                  including the end zones. It has science labs from the United
                  States, Russia, Japan and Europe.
                </p>

                <h4>What Are the Parts of the Space Station?</h4>
                <p>
                  The space station has many parts. The parts are called
                  modules. The first modules had parts needed to make the space
                  station work. Astronauts also lived in those modules. Modules
                  called "nodes" connect parts of the station to each other.
                  Labs on the space station let astronauts do research. <br />
                  <br />

                  On the sides of the space station are solar arrays. These
                  arrays collect energy from the sun. They turn sunlight into
                  electricity. Robot arms are attached outside. The robot arms
                  helped to build the space station. They also can move
                  astronauts around outside and control science experiments.
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  Airlocks on the space station are like doors. Astronauts use
                  them to go outside on spacewalks. <br />
                  <br />

                  Docking ports are like doors, too. The ports allow visiting
                  spacecraft to connect to the space station. New crews and
                  visitors enter the station through the docking ports.
                  Astronauts fly to the space station on the Russian Soyuz. The
                  crew members use the ports to move supplies onto the station.
                </p>

                <h4>Why Is the Space Station Important?</h4>
                <p>
                  The space station is a home in orbit. People have lived in
                  space every day since the year 2000. The space station's labs
                  are where crew members do research. This research could not be
                  done on Earth.
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  Scientists study what happens to people when they live in
                  space. NASA has learned how to keep a spacecraft working for a
                  long time. These lessons will be important in the future.
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  NASA has a plan to send humans deeper into space than ever
                  before. The space station is one of the first steps. NASA will
                  use lessons from the space station to get astronauts ready for
                  the journey ahead.
